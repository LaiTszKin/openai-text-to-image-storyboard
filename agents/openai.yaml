  default_prompt: "Use $openai-text-to-image-storyboard to decide scene prompts from text and generate images into pictures/{content_name}/ as soon as content is available. For recurring characters, define one JSON skeleton per character (id/name/appearance/outfit/description) before generation, then keep the same skeleton in every relevant scene and only change description. Handle multi-character scenes by including all involved character skeletons in the same scene payload. Load API settings from /Users/tszkinlai/.codex/skills/openai-text-to-image-storyboard/.env by default."
